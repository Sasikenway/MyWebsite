                <p class="lead">
                    As a developer, I believe that technology has the power to transform the world, solve real-world problems, and enhance human experiences. For me, the thrill of building something from scratch — whether it's a simple web page or a complex web application — is a deeply satisfying process. The opportunity to constantly learn, adapt, and create innovative solutions is what fuels my passion for development.
